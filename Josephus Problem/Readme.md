# *Josephus Problem*

The Josephus problem is a mathematical puzzle that involves eliminating a group of people according to a specific pattern until only one person remains. It is named after the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, who described how he and his fellow survivors of the siege of Masada decided to avoid capture by the Romans by forming a circle and killing every other person until only one remained.
